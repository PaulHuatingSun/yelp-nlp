    "# 📄 Food Safety Concern Detection from Yelp Reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "This script identifies potential **food safety issues** mentioned in Yelp reviews by using **semantic similarity** between review sentences and a curated set of **food safety-related phrases**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to **automatically flag reviews** that describe serious food safety concerns like food poisoning, spoiled food, and hospital visits, using natural language processing and BERT embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of What We Did\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loaded NLP models**  \n",
    "  - Used **spaCy** for sentence parsing and POS tagging.\n",
    "  - Used **SentenceTransformer (MiniLM)** for creating dense sentence embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Defined key food safety phrases**  \n",
    "  - Created a list of common expressions related to food safety incidents.\n",
    "  - Computed normalized embeddings for these phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prepared the review dataset**  \n",
    "  - Removed reviews without text.\n",
    "  - Focused only on **negative or neutral reviews** (stars ≤ 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extracted candidate sentences**  \n",
    "  - Parsed reviews into individual sentences.\n",
    "  - Filtered sentences that:\n",
    "    - Mentioned food-related terms (like \"burger\", \"meal\", \"pizza\")\n",
    "    - Did **not** contain negations (\"not good\", \"didn't get sick\", etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Calculated semantic similarity**  \n",
    "  - Computed similarity between extracted sentences and food safety phrases.\n",
    "  - Recorded the best matching phrase and score for each sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flagged potential food safety incidents**  \n",
    "  - Flagged reviews where the highest similarity score exceeded **0.65**.\n",
    "  - Recorded the matched sentence and matched phrase.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Displayed sample results**  \n",
    "  - Showed the top 5 flagged reviews for quick inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tested different thresholds**  \n",
    "  - Checked how the number of flagged reviews changes at different similarity thresholds (0.5, 0.6, 0.7).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Output\n",
    "\n",
    "- A filtered dataset (`final_df_filtered`) containing a `food_safety_flag` for each review.\n",
    "- Highlighted sentences that strongly resemble known food safety concerns.\n",
    "- Ready for further manual review or automated reporting.\n",

It's very diner-y and not aesthetically pleasing indoors but it has outdoor benches outside which is nice. Service is fine. There is parking. My rating comes from the food itself... it's just not great. I've gotten the chicken tandoori platter and a paratha wrap. The sides for the chicken tandoori were very subpar. Iceberg lettuce mix, chickpeas, and a few other options, none of which looked or tasted good. The chicken itself was okay at best. Too much rice, and it was oily.

My last visit I found a hair in my food. They remade my order, and that also came with hair in the food. I dumbly decided after a long boycott to stop in because I was near by and starving. Dumb choice. They brought me apple sauce that tasted like pickles. I ordered a simple meal and then they told me no grits. So I switched my order to French toast with eggs and bacon. They added some hashbrowns and toast I immediately ask the waitress wait what about my french toast. She was like oh the hasbrowns they just gave you. I guessed same for the toast  WRONG. My bill comes and they've charged me for two meals. Smh. I should have listened to my instinct and got Popeyes  NEVER AGAIN  \n",

When I found the hair I had already eaten most of the meal, so I just informed the waitress, paid, and left. The fish and chips is good after you squeeze out all the oil off the fish because it swims in the abundance of oil as if it's still in the ocean.

Cleanliness is not at all a concern for the owners/managers.  I have gotten food poisoning twice from the restaurant years apart (once in 2012 and once in 2014) and each time, I was sick for about 10 days, missing quite a bit of work.  I've heard from others that this is the norm for Distrito.  When it happened in 2012, I didn't know whether it was from a lunch I'd had at Distrito, or something else.  After it happened again last year, I have not been back.  If you have a weak stomach or any kind of digestive or autoimmune issue, I would avoid eating here.  \n",

The order being wrong was probably an omen. I got food poisoning! I couldn't keep any food down, or liquid, and lost 14lbs with a consistent fever of 100. Maybe this is one in a million, maybe not. But chances are if it happened once it will happen again. Never going back.  \n",

However, I have been here a total of 3 times. And 2 of of those there's been something in our food! The first time we found 3 hairs in our food. I didn't write a review because I understand, things sometimes happen. However, we went today and there was a piece of plastic in our food! Again, stuff happens. But I've completely lost my appetite to even go back here unfortunately. I hope they can start being more careful with their food prep area.  \n",
       "25473   My first time there and the place is really nice . The weight staff is mostly attentive a but more stuck up than anything else . \\n\\nNow for the food : Me and my boyfriend had lobster bisque and crab cocktail as appetizer for main course he had fish and me the lamb chops with asparagus.\\nAccompanies by 2 drinks each 3 alcoholic and one sparking water . \\nThe lamb chops came out rubbery and overdone barely cut through em , the asparagus was bland and had no taste at all they could have threw a few sprinkles of salt and pepper on there for taste . \\nI didn't want to make a fuss and ruin the special evening so I didn't speak up . \\nAll that came to 250$ that's highway robbery if you ask me ! \\nTo add insult few hours after were home I'm violently throwing up the food we just had.\\nMy puking continued all next day accompanied with a lovely head ache .\\nSay what you want but to me this looks like food poisoning . \\nThere's no way In f@@@@ hell should anyone be sick after spending 250$ on dinner . \\nIn closing in my opinion in would not recommend this place actually  I would advise you stay clear , unless that is you have money to burn and want to get sick from food .\\n\\nStay away !!!!  \n",

It's very diner-y and not aesthetically pleasing indoors but it has outdoor benches outside which is nice. Service is fine. There is parking. My rating comes from the food itself... it's just not great. I've gotten the chicken tandoori platter and a paratha wrap. The sides for the chicken tandoori were very subpar. Iceberg lettuce mix, chickpeas, and a few other options, none of which looked or tasted good. The chicken itself was okay at best. Too much rice, and it was oily. The second time I came here I got sick after eating the food. 2/5  "
